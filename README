This C++ project implements a family of virtual machines.
Each virtual machine has a set of registers, stack and memory, takes textual code, and emulates it on the machine.

* A note about using shared objects in Linux: Make sure to "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH", so that driver.out can find vm.so

* Example usage: 
	make
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	./driver.out < test.s

Current files:
=============
vm.cpp/h - for the virtual machine (compiled into a shared object through the Makefile).
test.c - some simple file which is compiled into assembly - to have something to feed the machine.
driver.cpp - a driver to run some tests.
