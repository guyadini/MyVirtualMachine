This C++ project implements a family of virtual machines.
Each virtual machine has a set of registers, stack and memory, takes textual code, and emulates it on the machine.


Current files:
=============
vm.cpp/h - for the virtual machine (compiled into a shared object through the Makefile).
test.c - some simple file which is compiled into assembly - to have something to feed the machine.
